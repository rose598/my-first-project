### 
Foo Corporation needs a program to calculate how much to pay their hourly employees. The US Department of Labor 
requires that employees get paid time and a half for any hours over 40 that they work in a single week. For example, if an 
employee works 45 hours, they get 5 hours of overtime, at 1.5 times their base pay. The State of Massachusetts requires 
that hourly employees be paid at least $8.00 an hour. Foo Corp requires that an employee not work more than 60 hours in 
a week.
An employee gets paid (hours worked) × (base pay), for each hour up to 40 hours. 
For every hour over 40, they get overtime = (base pay) × 1.5. 
The base pay must not be less than the minimum wage ($8.00 an hour). If it is, print an error. 
If the number of hours is greater than 60, print an error messag
